# BrisHack 24 - Posture Detection App
Team members: Austin Doubleday, James Rennie, Jiang Yiqing
### Overview
The initial idea was to enter the wearable catagory and the hardware catagory. The design had two parts, a wearable box to store a phone on your back, and an app that existed on the phone to detect the posture and bring it to the attention of the user.
### Development
We used android studio and an android emulator initially to design a UI and experiment with different detection methods. After we decided on accelerometer data to detect the rotation of the phone we switched to using our phones plugged into android studio.\
